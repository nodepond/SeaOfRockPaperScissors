Instructions
------------

You need ruby and a console to play this game.

To install the game, just clone it from github:

```

Then change directory
```
cd SeaOfRockPaperScissors
```

Start the game
```
ruby go.rb
```

Bonus
-----

Mac-pirates will also like to install the Pirates.terminal color-scheme. 

Unfortunately I did not found a good method to let the music play in a looped style on all systems, so there is no music, but the mp3-file still lives in there.
